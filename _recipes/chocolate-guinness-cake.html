  <h2 class="secondary-heading">Introduction</h2>

  <p class="body-copy">This cake is magnificent in its damp blackness. I can't say that you can absolutely taste the stout in it, but there is certainly a resonant, ferrous tang which I happen to love. The best way of describing it is to say that it's like gingerbread without the spices.</p>

  <p class="body-copy">There is enough sugar - a certain understatement here - to counter any potential bitterness of the Guinness, and although I've eaten versions of this made up like a chocolate sandwich cake, stuffed and slathered in a rich chocolate icing, I think that can take away from its dark majesty. Besides, I wanted to make a cream cheese frosting to echo the pale head that sits on top of a glass of stout. It's unconventional to add cream but it makes it frothier and lighter which I regard as aesthetically and gastronomically desirable. But it is perfectly acceptable to leave the cake un-iced: in fact, it tastes gorgeous plain.</p>

  <h2 class="secondary-heading">Ingredients</h2>

  <h3 class="tertiary-heading">for the cake</h3>

  <ul class="italicised-body-copy">
    <li>250ml guinness</li>
    <li>250g unsalted butter</li>
    <li>75g cocoa powder</li>
    <li>400g caster sugar</li>
    <li>142ml sour cream</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>275g plain flour</li>
    <li>2½ tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="tertiary-heading">for the topping</h3>

  <ul class="italicised-body-copy"> 
    <li>300g Cream Cheese</li>
    <li>150g Icing Sugar</li>
    <li>125ml Double Cream (or Whipping Cream)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="secondary-heading">Method</h2>

  <ol class="body-copy">
    <li>Preheat the oven to gas mark 4/180°C/350ºF, and butter and line a 23cm / 9 inch springform tin.</li>
    <li>Pour the Guinness into a large wide saucepan, add the butter - in spoons or slices - and heat until the butter's melted, at which time you should whisk in the cocoa and sugar. Beat the sour cream with the eggs and vanilla and then pour into the brown, buttery, beery pan and finally whisk in the flour and bicarb.</li>
    <li>Pour the cake batter into the greased and lined tin and bake for 45 minutes to an hour. Leave to cool completely in the tin on a cooling rack, as it is quite a damp cake.</li>
    <li>When the cake's cold, sit it on a flat platter or cake stand and get on with the icing. Lightly whip the cream cheese until smooth, sieve over the icing sugar and then beat them both together. Or do this in a processor, putting the unsieved icing sugar in first and blitz to remove lumps before adding the cheese.</li>
    <li>Add the cream and beat again until it makes a spreadable consistency. Ice the top of the black cake so that it resembles the frothy top of the famous pint.</li>
  </ol>
